Masonry Network Analysis for Construction History

Manacoh is an open-source software that studies the stability of historic
masonry vaults that have a strong 3D geometry: domes, helicoidal vaults. It uses the
thrust network analysis. This method replace the well-known inverted catenary by
an inverted net, called thrust network. Our implementation of the technique focus on
the field of construction history. Pre-set examples taken from XVIII e to XX e century
are included.
